\begin{abstract}
  We show that eigenvector centrality behaves poorly on sparse random networks with vertices of unusually high degree, or hubs. We give numerical and analytical evidence that traditional eigenvector centrality is susceptible to localization, giving disproportionately high centrality to hubs and their neighbors. We propose an alternative centrality measure, \emph{non-backtracking centrality}, which converges to eigenvector centrality for dense networks and avoids the problem of localization around hubs in sparse networks.

Eigenvector centrality is popular and has many uses.

It is based on the leading eigenvector, which has been studied in depth. Chung~\etal~\cite{chung03} lower bounded it by the weighted average of the squares of node degrees and by the square root of the largest degree. Many sparse graphs have little degree variation, and thus their leading eigenvector is a global measure corresponding to the weighted average of squared degrees, and is robust to local changes.

However, the leading eigenvalue is also bounded by the square root of the largest degree. For networks with unbalanced enough degree distributions, the leading eigenvalue corresponds to the largest hub in the network. Nadakuditi and Newman~\cite{nadakuditi13} analyze this phenomenon for Erd\H{o}s--R\'enyi random graphs with a planted hub. They show the existance of an eigenvalue for the hub vertex, and show that as the hub grows, its eigenvalue overtakes the average-degree eigenvalue.

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Regular eigenvector centrality doesn't work.
  \begin{itemize}
	\item Introduce Hub model, talk about localization, order parameter.
	\item Give numerical results on model, real networks?
	\item Power law network theoretical results + numerics.
  \end{itemize}
  \item Hashimoto matrix
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Analytic introduction, forbidding of backtracking, echo chamber result.
    \item Tends to eigenvector centrality when dense.
    \item 2n x 2n formulation
    \item Numerical results
  \end{itemize}
  \item Doesn't work on trees, Belief Propagation / core periphery
\end{enumerate}
