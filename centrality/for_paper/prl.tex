\begin{abstract}
  We show that eigenvector centrality behaves poorly on sparse random networks with vertices of unusually high degree, or hubs. We give numerical and analytical evidence that traditional eigenvector centrality is susceptible to localization, giving disproportionately high centrality to hubs and their neighbors. We propose an alternative centrality measure, \emph{non-backtracking centrality}, which converges to eigenvector centrality for dense networks and avoids the problem of localization around hubs in sparse networks.

Network researchers have long been interested in an effective method of measuring \emph{centrality}, a quantification of how important or central each network node is. Eigenvector centrality~\cite{bonacich72} is among the most influential centrality measures, with widely ranging applications to metabolic networks~\cite{ding10}, football team ranking~\cite{keener93}, bird mating analysis~\cite{ryder08}, and Google's highly successful PageRank algorithm\footnote{PageRank uses a closely related variant of eigenvector centrality}~\cite{page99}. Eigenvector centrality specifies that each node's centrality be proportional to the sum of its neighbor's centralities, and can be conveniently calculated from the leading eigenvector of the network's adjacency matrix. Chung~\etal show that the largest eigenvalue of the adjacency matrix of a random graph model is almost surely determined by the larger of the square root of the maximum degree, $\sqrt{m}$, and the weighted average of the squares of the expected degrees, $\tilde{d}$~\cite{chung03}. In this paper we show that, at least for the Poisson with planted hub and power law random graph families, eigenvector centrality fails when the leading eigenvalue corresponds to $\sqrt{m}$ by giving a centrality vector which is too-localized around the highest degree node. In the second half of this paper we introduce \emph{non-backtracking centrality}, calculated from an alternative network representation called the non-backtracking matrix~\cite{krzakala13} or Hashimoto edge matrix~\cite{hashimoto89}, which avoids this failure case of eigenvector centrality while remaining asymptotically equal in the dense limit.

We first consider the Poisson random graph with nodes of identical expected degree $c$ and a planted hub of expected degree $k_n$. In Fig.~\ref{fig:transition} we display eigenvector (left column) and non-backtracking (right column) centralities for the hub and all nodes within distance 2, from the same Poisson random graph with size $n=1000000$ and $c = 10$. The rows show increasing hub size, from $k_n = 20$, $k_n = 70$, and $k_n = 120$. The eigenvector centralities, which are proportional to node areas, increase dramatically from $k_n = 70$ to $k_n = 120$ while the non-backtracking centralities increase steadily. We demonstrate below that this sudden increase in centrality is an undesirable side-effect of a phase transition in the leading eigenvalue.

Nadakuditi and Newman give careful analysis of the spectrum of random graphs with arbitrary expected degree, and show that high degree hubs in a network generate their own eigenvalues~\cite{nadakuditi13}. For the Poisson random graph with a planted hub, they calculate a hub eigenvalue of $k_n / \sqrt{k_n - c}$ in addition to the well known eigenvalue corresponding to the average degree of $c+1$. Setting these equal to each other and solving for $k_n$, we see that the hub eigenvalue overtakes the average degree eigenvalue at
\begin{equation}
k_n = c(c+1).
\label{eqn:crossover}
\end{equation}
Figure~\ref{fig:evalues} shows the results of numerical calculations of the largest (black solid line) and second largest (green dashed line) eigenvalues for a Poisson random graph with a single additional hub of expected degree $k_n$, as a function of $k_n$. These values closely follow the predicted results, and we can see them crossover at $k_n = 110$, according to Eq.~\ref{eqn:crossover}. Below $k_n = 30$ we see that the hub eigenvalue has fallen into the well studied continuous band of eigenvalues, detailed by Nadakuditi and Newman~\cite{nadakuditi13}. Figure~\ref{fig:order-parameter} shows that this crossover results in a phase-transition in the eigenvector elements and localization around the hub. We measure the degree of localization of the leading eigenvector $\vec{x}$ using the order parameter $Q(\vec{x})$, where $Q(\vec{x}) = 1$ corresponds to the most localized eigenvector (a vector with one element equal to $1$ and the rest equal to $0$) and $Q(\vec{x}) = 0$ corresponds to the least localized eigenvector (an infinitely long uniform vector)
\[Q(\vec{x}) = \sqrt[4]{\sum_{i=1}^n x_i ^ 4}.\]
We expect a small and steady increase in $Q$ as the hub size increases, but instead find a dramatic phase transition where the eigenvalues crossover, as the majority of the weight of the eigenvector shifts to the hub and its neighbors.

One might dismiss this localization, saying that the Poisson random graph is not representative of real world networks. However, eigenvector centrality may fail on any network with low average degree and high degree variability. For example, Chung~\etal find a similar crossover for random power law graphs~\cite{chung03}. They show that, with high probability, networks with power law exponent $\Beta > 2.5$ have a leading eigenvalue corresponding to the square root of the maximum degree, $\sqrt{m}$, while those with $\Beta < 2.5$ have a leading eigenvalue corresponding to average squared degree, $\tilde{d}$. In Figure~\ref{fig:power-law} we see this effect in action. As the power law exponent increases the order parameter increases, despite the fact that the Gini coefficient is decreasing. % I can derive this if necessary. Currently this power law paragraph is not as dramatic as desired, what is a good null model for how centrality should behave? Hashimoto centrality has a phase transition at 2.5, which is good?
Real world applications of eigenvector centrality to networks known to have power law degree distributions are ubiquitous~\cite{canright06,page99}. Our results suggest that eigenvector centrality may overweight the centrality of high degree nodes~\footnote{As we show below, though network factors such as assortativity and clustering may influence the centrality measure, they do not change the presence of a high lying eigenvalues corresponding to hub nodes.}, especially when the power-law exponent is above $2.5$~\footnote{Interestingly, though many networks have a power-law exponent $2 < \Beta < 2.5$, and many approach $\Beta = 2.5$ we found networks with $\Beta > 2.5$ to be very rare~\cite{newman03}.}.




analyze the leading eigenvalue of networks generated by the configuration model with power law degree distributions of different exponents, and demonstrate a transition from an eigenvalue corresponding to the average squared degree to an eigenvalue corresponding to the square root of the maximum degree, at an exponent of $2.5$. In Figure~\ref{fig:power-law} we see this corresponds to an increase in order parameter, despite the fact that a higher power law exponent is representative of a less uniform degree distribution. This suggests that real-world networks with power-law exponent greater than 2.5 can expect localization around the largest network hub. This might affect algorithms which depend on eigenvector-centrality related measures, such as PageRank.


The underlying cause of eigenvector centrality's undesirable properties is an echo chamber effect resulting from each node's centrality being influenced by its neighbors centralities. Each of the hub's neighbors obtain high centrality because they are connected to the hub, which has high centrality. The hub obtains high centrality because it has high degree, and also because it is connected to many nodes which are deemed central on account of their being connected to the hub. This amplification of centrality is what allows for extreme localization, and can be avoided by a centrality measure which takes into account neighbor centrality, but only neighbor centrality derived from nodes \emph{other than oneself}.

This concept is perfectly encapsulated by the non-backtracking matrix, or Hashimoto matrix, which has been employed and analyzed in a variety of contexts~\cite{hashimoto89,angel07,krzakala13}. The non-backtracking matrix is a $2m \times 2m$ representation of a graph in which undirected graph is turned into two directed edges, and edge $(i,j)$ is connected to every edge leaving $j$ except for its reciprocal, $(j,i)$.

This forbidding of backtracking prevents the echo chamber effect of eigenvector centrality, and solves all of the problems we've seen so far. (We analyze each of the figures and show how much more consistent it is).

We can see that non-backtracking centrality largely corresponds to eigenvector centrality. This correspondance is exact in the limit of large networks, as the one excluded edge from each edge is asymptotically negligible.

A $2m \times 2m$ matrix can be significantly larger than the original $n \times n$ adjacency matrix, and could raise concerns of intractibility. As shown in by Krzakala~\etal~\cite{krzakala13}, it is possible to compute the non-backtracking centrality of each node using only a $2n \times 2n$ matrix (show the matrix).



This centrality measure is great, but certainly not an end-all be-all. For example, it doesn't work on trees. The problem of reasonable behavior on trees has yet to be solved. We also believe there are related problems here, including belief propagation and the computation of core-periphery structure.
